## Usage

This project provide a minimum implement of [bazel remote execution](https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis), can be used to learn how bazel remote execution works.

I also expect this project can be complete gradually, and can be used in the production environment. 

## Development

modify codes in `cmd` and `pkg`, and run following script

```bash
./deploy/docker-compose/up.sh
```
